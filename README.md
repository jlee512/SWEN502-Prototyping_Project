# SWEN502-Prototyping_Project
Group Project 1 for SWEN502. Prototyping exercise, 3 day project. Team mates: Madeleine St-Laurent-Guerin, Gurtej Singh (Front-end design) and Jack Humphrey (front-end design)

This project was created as team prototpying exercise. The brief was to create an application that allows customers to specify via an online system a custom burger order.

The three required components were:
1) A user app that enables customers to create delicious custom burger ordres
2) A database of custom orders and stock of ingredients
3) A production line app, that retrieves orders from the database for production

Key considerations were: cybersecurity, human-computer interaction and databases.

Note: to run through use cases for the program, run the project from your IDE and close before commencing another use case. This is a consequence of rapid-prototyping.
